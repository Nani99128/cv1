<p>A year later, in 1907 the second flag was hoisted by Madame Cama and her band of exiled revolutionaries.<br>This flag was similar to the first one, but some changes were adapted.<br>The colour of top strip was changed to saffron, the middle remained yellow, while the bottom-most strip turned green. The lotuses on the top strip were replaced with stars, while the position of crescent and sun were swapped.</p>
